# Tetris-2048
  The project combines two classic games, Tetris and 2048.  
  Its rule is to generate a block with values in the map and drop it at the bottom of the map.  
  The values of blocks are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and the probability of their generation is different.  
  A block crash the same block will generate a new block, which is twice the original value. Note that it can only crash from top to bottom, not left to right or right to left.
